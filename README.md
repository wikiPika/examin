# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You've seen these projects before (I hope).

Run `npm i` and then `npm start`.

## Specifics

Programmed largely in React and Typescript, with a complementary OCR side-application hosted by u/MericGit and an upload script by u/Tymur999.

A custom-built library on top of Framer Motion was used to implement animations.

Page routing was provided by React Router.

Database and hosting was provided by Firebase.

Every React component on the page was hand-crafted with love and chocolates.
